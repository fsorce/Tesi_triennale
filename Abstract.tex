In this document we introduce the concept of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry through the example of the Grassmannian scheme.

The first chapter introduces the basics of the functorial approach to algebraic geometry and its relation to moduli problems.

The second chapter is a quick overview of Grassmannians as defined set theoretically. We focus our attention on the Pl\"ucker embedding and prove that it identifies the Grassmannian with a projective variety.

In the third chapter we describe the reduced scheme structure on the Grassmannian and prove that it is a fine moduli space for the functor of quotients from $\Oc_T^n$ to a rank $k$ vector bundle on $T$.
